## Background

In July 2015, my parents and I officially opened our family restaurant in Farmington, Michigan. We were like a scrappy little startup without funding, taking one day at a time and hoping we'd still be open tomorrow. I felt we were the right team to build the most authentic, clean, and fresh Chinese restaurant locally.

Our first customers were us walking across town passing out flyers. As we grew, we needed a more scalable solution to the problem. I had heard of Wix, Squarespace, and different platforms designed for restaurants, but none of them were capable of building web apps at scale at a low cost. I came across Bubble, and I leveraged it to build an online ordering app and internal inventory tracker.

Bubble brought me to the world of programming and led me to pursue it as a major in college. Bubble truly occupies a special place in my heart. So, I took the next step in my journey from using the platform to building the platform.

## About Bubble

Each day, Bubble's no-code platform introduces new people to the joy and magic of building software.

## Takeaways

As a power-user of Bubble, I am truly amazed by what I - and the billions around the world - can build on Bubble. It still boggles my mind that a 15-year old kid can use Bubble and a 20-year old kid can contribute to the platform that will democratize technology to everyone across the globe. I am excited for all that's yet to come. Check it out at www.bubble.io.
