## Background

I started my Amazon SDE internship earlier this month, and while there are many good documentations
that get me up to speed on internal tools, none of them tell me to customize my terminal.

The terminal is not just a source for compiling code - many developers interact with it by performing
daily Git workflow, launching the build system, testing, and more. The terminal is also used by IDEs such as
IntelliJ and VSCode.

We use the terminal everywhere as developers to get work done. **In just 10 minutes or less** I'll take you
through my setup. Why not invest the time upfront to make it simple, beautiful, and easy to use? ðŸ˜‰

**Note**: This blog is tailored towards MacOS users.

## iTerm2

First, we need to pick a Terminal. Mac comes with a preinstalled Terminal. While that works fine,
iTerm2 does a much better job at customization capabilities.

Head over to iTerm2's website and install the app locally: https://iterm2.com/

## Customizing iTerm2

### Nerd Fonts

There are many pretty fonts out there that take your terminal experience to the next level. Nerd
fonts are really good because they are comfortable on the eyes and has special icon support.

Check out this Nerd font website to install them: https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads

Here's a list of my favorites and what they look like:

- [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#jetbrainsmono)
- [SourceCodePro](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#source-code-pro)
- [FiraCode](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#firacode)

### Appearance

Open up iTerm2. It should look similar to your usual Terminal app, but the magic is all in the settings.
Click on iTerm on the top left corner, then click on **Settings** (or "**Preferences**" if older Mac).

**General**

1. Under **Closing**, uncheck everything
2. Under **Window**, only check "Adjust window when changing font size," "Native full screen windows,"
   and "Separate window title per tab."

**Appearance**

1. Under **General**, the theme is Minimal, Tab/Status Bar should be at the top.
2. Under **Panes**, I have the first and last items checked.
3. Minimize **Dimming** amount to your liking.

**Profile**

1. Under **Colors**, you can choose a preset theme on the bottom right or import your own. I love these
   colors: https://iterm2colorschemes.com/
2. Under **Text**, pick the Nerd font you installed previously. I like to set text size to about 16/18, and bold
   if possible.

**The Rest**

Feel free to spice up the terminal. These are just settings that have worked well for me over the years.

## Starship

<Image src={starship} alt="" />

Now, you've installed the basics. You might see iTerm2 still feels very much like a regular terminal. Let's
spice up for our daily workflow.

Let's get rid of the redundant information on the left (about the computer) and make our shells super fast.

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) is a cross-shell prompt that is minimal, customizable, and blazing-fast. It is compatible with
shells like Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.

Follow the instructions provided here: https://starship.rs/. You can skip the Nerd Font step, since we've already
completed it above :) I recommend using Homebrew to install Starship and other packages in the future. If you
don't have that already installed, copy-pasta this into your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Starship is written in Rust, which means it's fast and has low energy footprint.

## Autosuggestions

Lastly, if you use `zsh` shell, you can install [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
that will make the dimmed suggestions you saw with Starship shell. It essentially memorizes your previous
commands, and matches text suggestions on the fly.

Be sure to add the command to your `~/.zshrc` file as specified in the installation instructions.

Now, restart your terminal and begin typing. You will start to see suggestions pop up. If you don't, then
type a few more commands. It'll start to memorize them. Once you see those suggestions, tap on the right
arrow to complete the suggestions!

**Congrats! You have a beautiful terminal that is lightweight, fast, and beautiful to use ðŸš€**

~ Peter
